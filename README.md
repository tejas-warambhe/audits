## About me

Hi, I am Tejas Warambhe, a developer turned Independent Security Researcher specializing in blockchain security. I have been auditing EVM-based smart contracts since July 2024.

In October 2024, I made a difficult call to leave development as I was not enjoying it as much as I used to.
I believe that I am a natural at problem-solving, debugging, and finding absurd paths to situations. This was an evidence-based finding for myself (N-of-1 Research) as well as via people (N-of-5) who know me well enough to testify that my core capabilities as a natural were reduced down to the above mentioned in the most basic terms possible.

I found myself hiding behind the curtain of development to show myself and the people around me that I could "solve" any trivial/non-trivial problem. Over the time span of 2.5 years of hardcore development, I no longer find a problem non-solvable given the problem is not revolutionary but the world around me has a very large subset of work being menial and non-exciting in terms of my capabilities, which is why it is no longer exciting anymore. I enjoy creating architecture, database schemas, discussing solutions related to complex dev issues, optimizing code to reduce latency of services, making rational arguments related to trade-offs involved in complex systems, researching topics to understand the worst-case and best-case scenarios, debugging dev issues as well as losing sleep over it till I find a solution for it, etc. Eventually writing code became boring to me because I knew I would be able to do it no matter what as there were no black boxes involved, which killed my excitement. 

I found solving a codeforces div 2 B / C problem more exciting any day over a straight problem on leetcode, it's the context and hidden problem that excites me otherwise it just becomes a straightforward question, during my job hunt before deciding to go all in on auditing, I found myself speedrunning leetcode which made me question what I was even doing?

This portfolio stands as a testament to my decision to pursue auditing full-time due to my natural capabilities aligning closely with the nature of auditing.
